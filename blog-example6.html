              <p>
                Your dog’s nutritional health depends on receiving the correct
                amounts and proportions of nutrients from the six required
                groups: water, protein, fat, carbohydrate, minerals and
                vitamins. With the exception of water, commercial dog foods
                identified as 100% complete and balanced contain all of these
                required nutrients.
              </p>
              <p id="bold">Water</p>
              <p>
                Water is essential in helping regulate body temperature,
                lubrication of body tissues and as a fluid medium for the blood
                and lymph systems. Because water is involved in practically
                every reaction within an animal’s body, any large deviation will
                be associated with adverse effects. Dogs, therefore, have
                several systems designed to maintain constant water balance.
              </p>
              <p>
                Water intake is controlled by thirst, hunger, metabolic activity
                (work, gestation, lactation, growth) and the environment
                (humidity and temperature).
              </p>
              <p>
                Dogs get most of their water by simply drinking it, but they
                also get some from fluid ingested with food, and water generated
                from metabolic processes in the body. Water is primarily lost in
                urine, feces and respiration.
              </p>
              <p>
                How much water a dog needs is determined in large part by the
                amount of food they consume each day. A general guideline is
                that dogs require 1 mL of water for each kcal of energy. For
                nursing females, the water requirement will be increased to
                support milk production. Water should always be freely available
                for your dog.
              </p>
              <p id="bold">
                Calories
              </p>
              <p>
                Energy is measured in calories. A calorie is defined as the
                amount of heat required to raise the temperature of 1 gram of
                water from 14.5 degrees Celsius to 15.5 degrees Celsius. Because
                this amount of heat is so small, it is common to describe energy
                requirements and the energy content of foods in kilocalories
                (1000 calories = 1 kcal). The term Calorie, written with a
                capital C, is often used to refer to the amount of energy in 1
                kilocalorie of food.
              </p>
              <p id="bold">
                Food and water consumption
              </p>
              <p>
                When the water content of a diet increases, the dog or cat
                usually drinks less water. For example, dogs consuming canned
                diets, which contain approximately 70%–75% water, will generally
                drink less water than dogs consuming dry diets, which contain
                about 8%–12% water.

              <p id="bold">
                Protein
              </p>
              <p>
                Protein is an essential nutrient and serves numerous functions
                in the body, such as muscle growth, tissue repair, enzymes,
                transporting oxygen in the blood, immune functions and as a
                source of energy.
              </p>
              <p>
                More than 20 amino acids are involved in the synthesis of
                protein in the body, and there are two basic kinds: essential
                and nonessential. Essential amino acids are the kind that the
                body can’t produce, or produce in sufficient quantities, fast
                enough on its own in order to grow and stay healthy. These are
                the kind that must be supplied through diet. Nonessential amino
                acids are produced in sufficient amounts in the body naturally,
                and generally don’t need to be supplemented through diet.
              </p>
              <p>
                Also, essential amino acids aren’t stored as such in the body
                for any significant period of time. They are constantly
                metabolized, and need to be replenished regularly in the right
                proportions through diet.
              </p>
              <p id="bold">Dogs require 10 essential amino acids:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Arginine</li>
                <li>Histidine</li>
                <li>Isoleucine</li>

                Carbohydrate sources
              </p>
              <p>
                Carbohydrate sources are sugars, starches and insoluble fiber.
                Simple sugars are the smallest carbohydrate molecules and are
                easily digested and absorbed. By contrast, complex
                carbohydrates, or starches, are combinations of simple sugars
                forming long chains that require more digestion before they can
                be absorbed into the bloodstream. Insoluble fibers are
                carbohydrates that are not digestible by dogs or cats.
              </p>
              <p>
                In manufactured pet foods, most dietary carbohydrates are
                grains, such as wheat, corn and rice.
              </p>
              <p>
                The primary site of carbohydrate digestion is in the small
                intestine, where these complex compounds are broken down to
                glucose (a simple sugar). Glucose is the normal source of energy
                used by most cells in the body.
              </p>
              <p>
                When dogs and cats consume diets containing more energy than is
                needed, excess carbohydrate energy is stored in the form of
                glycogen in the liver and muscles, and is converted to fat and
                stored in adipose tissues. During periods of fasting, stress or
                exercise, glycogen is broken down to glucose and delivered to
                the bloodstream where it is distributed to all body tissues.
